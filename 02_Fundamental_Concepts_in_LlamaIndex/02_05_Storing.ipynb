In the last four lines of the poem is a lesson for\\r\\nour nation to-day. The seas upon which our ideals have launched us are\\r\\nperilous and uncharted. In some ways our whole voyage of democracy seems\\r\\nfutile. Shall we turn back, or shall we, like Columbus, answer the\\r\\nfalterers in words that leap like a leaping sword; \"Sail on, sail on\"?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    Behind him lay the gray Azores,\\r\\n  Behind the Gates of Hercules;\\r\\n  Before him not the ghost of shores:\\r\\n  Before him only shoreless seas.\\r\\n  The good mate said: \"Now must we pray,\\r\\n  For lo! the very stars are gone.\\r\\n  Brave Adm\\'r\\'l, speak; what shall I say?\"\\r\\n  \"Why, say: \\'Sail on! sail on! and on!\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n    \"My men grow mutinous day by day;\\r\\n  My men grow ghastly wan and weak.\"\\r\\n  The stout mate thought of home; a spray\\r\\n  Of salt wave washed his swarthy cheek.\\r\\n  \"What shall I say, brave Adm\\'r\\'l, say,\\r\\n  If we sight naught but seas at dawn?\"\\r\\n  \"Why, you shall say at break of day:\\r\\n  \\'Sail on! sail on! sail on! and on!\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n    They sailed and sailed, as winds might blow;\\r\\n  Until at last the blanched mate said:\\r\\n  \"Why, now not even God would know\\r\\n  Should I and all my men fall dead.\\r\\n  These very winds forget their way,\\r\\n  For God from these dread seas is gone.\\r\\n  Now speak, brave Adm\\'r\\'l; speak and say--\"\\r\\n  He said: \"Sail on!', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=195962, end_char_idx=199902, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), score=0.42069072),\n",
