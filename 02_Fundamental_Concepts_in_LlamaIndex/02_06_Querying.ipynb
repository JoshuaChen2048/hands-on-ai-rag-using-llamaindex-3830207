       "Response(response='The provided text contains a collection of poems and narratives that explore various themes, including the power of the human spirit, the importance of perseverance, and the value of inner strength. While some pieces focus on external battles, such as the poem \"Battle Cry,\" which speaks of the courage and determination required in physical combat, many delve into the internal struggles and triumphs of the human experience.\\n\\nOne recurring theme is the idea that true strength lies within the individual, and that external circumstances should not define one\\'s character. For instance, \"The Quitter\" encourages resilience in the face of adversity, emphasizing that it\\'s not the end result but the act of fighting that matters. Similarly, \"The Call of the Unbeaten\" highlights the importance of \"stick-to-it-iveness\" and determination in overcoming obstacles.\\n\\nThe poem \"Know Thyself\" takes this idea further, suggesting that the greatest battles are fought within the self. It describes a journey of self-discovery, where the narrator realizes that their own spirit is the source of their strength and resilience. This internal battle is portrayed as a struggle against fate and life\\'s challenges, but ultimately, the narrator finds the courage to rise and fight again.\\n\\nIn contrast, some pieces, like \"The Woman Who Understands,\" focus on the external influence of a supportive figure, highlighting how a quiet, encouraging presence can shape a person\\'s life and career.\\n\\nOverall, the narratives and poems in this collection present a nuanced view of internal and external battles, emphasizing that while external circumstances can be challenging, it is the individual\\'s inner strength, resilience, and self-awareness that ultimately define their character and determine their success.', source_nodes=[NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='3e712da1-abfb-421a-adda-c239aca95903', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': '../data/pg10763.txt', 'file_name': 'pg10763.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 405150, 'creation_date': '2025-09-19', 'last_modified_date': '2025-09-05'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='../data/pg10763.txt', node_type='4', metadata={'file_path': '../data/pg10763.txt', 'file_name': 'pg10763.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 405150, 'creation_date': '2025-09-19', 'last_modified_date': '2025-09-05'}, hash='858a9e79c3e93620378f6d9959a1333d695c67acf64e4e9ab23e4b6a89db2653'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='4c7dae34-7f22-4b4b-a083-004be54273d7', node_type='1', metadata={'file_path': '../data/pg10763.txt', 'file_name': 'pg10763.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 405150, 'creation_date': '2025-09-19', 'last_modified_date': '2025-09-05'}, hash='b9a6e28cdb2832fc73d49940b39743ecc9d63c55913174f6bd2c80fcd4e6df99'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='c451b438-fd8a-4298-be2e-2dae6486cbf4', node_type='1', metadata={}, hash='0235044e080d76d700cab358d0813983bbb070b79ca7e64fe3b98d2e9fa27e0e')}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='Ring, bells in unreared steeples,\\r\\n  The joy of unborn peoples!\\r\\n  Sound, trumpets far off blown,\\r\\n  Your triumph is my own.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Parcel and part of all,\\r\\n  I keep the festival,\\r\\n  Fore-reach the good to be,\\r\\n  And share the victory.\\r\\n\\r\\n  I feel the earth move sunward,\\r\\n  I join the great march onward,\\r\\n  And take, by faith, while living,\\r\\n  My freehold of thanksgiving.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_John Green leaf Whittier._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTO ALTHEA FROM PRISON\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the great Civil War in England between the Puritans and Charles the\\r\\nFirst the author of this poem sacrificed everything in the royal cause.\\r\\nThat cause was defeated and Lovelace was imprisoned.

Second is the\\r\\nfreedom brought by the recollection of good fellowship, when tried and\\r\\ntrue comrades took their wine straight--\"with no allaying Thames.\" Third\\r\\nis the freedom brought by remembrance of the king for whom he was\\r\\nsuffering.

But Longfellow\\r\\ntells us this view is all wrong. The past can take care of itself, and\\r\\nwe need not even worry very much about the future; but if we are true to\\r\\nour own natures, we must be up and doing in the present. Time is short,\\r\\nand mastery in any field of human activity is so long a process that it\\r\\nforbids us to waste our moments. Yet we must learn also how to wait and\\r\\nendure. In short, we must not become slaves to either indifference or\\r\\nimpatience, but must make it our business to play a man\\'s part in life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Tell me not, in mournful numbers,\\r\\n    Life is but an empty dream!--\\r\\n  For the soul is dead that slumbers,\\r\\n    And things are not what they seem.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Life is real!
